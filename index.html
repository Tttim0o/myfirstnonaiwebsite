<h2>Hi, this is my website for showcasing my projects and cool stuff i think there is.</h2>

<h3>I am a guy from Slovakia. I love technology, like phones, gaming and more technology. I think everyone should love technology too. This is the website that I made completely by myself without using any artificial intelligence or similar tools. I am also trying to get my hands on the Raspberry Pi 5 the Raspberry Pi 5 AI kit if it becomes available in the shop and 6 months of Mullvad VPN or a Bambu Lab A1 mini. I would be very happy if you can suggest some project ideas, for my technology projects for my Raspberry Pi 5 and other technology gadgets. You can ask some questions or sugest projects to this mail adress - admin@cernansky.xyz</h3>
